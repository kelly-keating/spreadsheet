# notes / thoughts

<!-- ## 2. the grid

- table vs divs. table makes sense
- inner work can be manipulated inputs vs display
- helper AA -->

## 3. enter data

- access?
  - inputs always present? surely too much
  - separate input like sheets
  - onclick switch
- data matrix, start data, but hold forms as well complex object
- lost on refresh, but we could keep tbh

## 5. forms

- methods
  1. just loop it, keep count to stop if inf
  2. flag for done, dive in, keep trck in list?
  - flag is obvs less intense, but inf catch seems complex
  - nodes track back/fwd? too much for now

## 7. pretty pretty

- buttons / header
- colors on errs?

## OTHER

- form validation
- localstorage
