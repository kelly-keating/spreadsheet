# notes / thoughts

<!-- ## 2. the grid

- table vs divs. table makes sense
- inner work can be manipulated inputs vs display
- helper AA -->

<!-- ## 3. enter data

- access?
  - inputs always present? surely too much
  - separate input like sheets
  - onclick switch
- data matrix, start data, but hold forms as well complex object
- lost on refresh, but we could keep tbh -->

## 5. forms

- methods
  1. just loop it, keep count to stop if inf
  2. flag for done, dive in, keep trck in list?
  - flag is obvs less intense, but inf catch seems complex
  - nodes track back/fwd? too much for now

## 7. pretty pretty

- buttons / header
- colors on errs?

## OTHER

- form validation
- localstorage
  - onload check if data stored or save flag exists
    - if not modal to ask if save to browser
  - if asked don't ask again but lil toggle in header
- create reference map for simple updating (& perhaps loop catching)
- redirect doesn't correct user input just forgive it
